The main objective of this project is automating the control of streetlights and failure detection in it. The streetlights will switch their states with respect to any impending motion in the neighbourhood and the intensity of natural light available. This will prevent unnecessary wastage of electricity and will also reduce human dependency to control  the streetlights. The authority can monitor the status of the streetlights and the motion in the streets using a webpage or an Android application.
