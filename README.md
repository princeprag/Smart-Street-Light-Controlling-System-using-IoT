The main objective of this project is automating the control
of streetlights and failure detection in it. The streetlights will
switch their states with respect to any impending motion in
the neighbourhood and the intensity of natural light available.
This will prevent unnecessary wastage of electricity and will
also reduce human dependency to control the streetlights.
The authority can monitor the status of the streetlights and
the motion in the streets using a webpage or an Android
application.
